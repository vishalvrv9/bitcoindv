This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a weekend project to explore data visualization (graphs) using svg and React. The data used is this case dummy (random) data. 

Future prospects: Will be hitting a useful api endpoint to use this analytics technique to fetch useful data

To view the app:

1) clone the repo
2) npm or yarn install
3) npm or yarn start
